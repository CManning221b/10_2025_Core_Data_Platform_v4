# Reusable Ontological Reasoning
Key Words: Ontology, Knowledge Graph, Semantic Reasoning, Process Graph
## Background:
Industrial data is complex, time dependent, and deeply reliant on domain expertise, yet current analysis pipelines
embed engineering logic in opaque, implementation-specific scripts that cannot be reused or validated.
Ontologies have been developed before which describe industrial assets or data flow processes, but these aren’t
typically unified into one entity.
## Objectives
This is a dynamic and reactive ontological reasoning process designed to represent and store engineering
knowledge around data processing for industrial asset inspections and to reduce redundant implementation and
knowledge degradation.
